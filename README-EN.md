![maa-cli latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/MaaAssistantArknights/maa-cli?filter=v*)

A simple CLI for [MAA](https://github.com/MaaAssistantArknights/MaaAssistantArknights) by Rust.
A alternative way use MAA on **Linux** and **macOS**.
Windows is not supported now,
because I don't have a Windows machine
and I'm not familiar with Windows development. PR is welcome.

## Feature

- Install and update MAA core and resources with `maa install` and `maa update`;
- Install and update self with `maa self install` and `maa self update`;
- Define tasks by TOML, YAML or JSON file, then run it by `maa run <task>`, see below for more details;
- Handle MAA core message for monitoring of MAA running status.

## Installation

You can install CLI by download prebuilt binary from
[release page](https://github.com/wangl-cc/maa-cli/releases/latest)
(universal-apple-darwin is for macOS, x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is for Linux),
and extract it to a directory in your `$PATH` (e.g. `$HOME/.local/bin`).

Once the CLI is installed, you can install `MaaCore` by `maa`:
```bash
maa install
```

**Note**: `adb` is not included in this CLI. Please make sure `adb` is installed, if you connect game with it.

## Usage and configuration

### Run a task

The `maa` is used to run some you defined tasks
(how to define a task will be introduced later):
```sh
maa run <task> [options]
```
More details about `maa run` can be found by `maa run --help`.
And Other commands can be found by `maa --help`.

### Config dir

Your config files (maa options, tasks, etc.) are located in your config dir.
You can get the config dir by `maa dir config` and
create it by `mkdir -p "$(maa dir config)"`.
**Note**: the double quotes is necessary for macOS user with zsh and bash.
Because the path may contains space and will be split into multiple arguments.

*Tip*: For macOS user who prefer to XDG style config directory,
you can set `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, e.g. `export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"`.
Alternatively, you can make a symlink from XDG style dir to Apple style dir:
```sh
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/maa"
ln -s "$HOME/.config/maa" "$(maa dir config)"
```

In below examples, we assume the config dir is `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR`.

### Maa options

The maa options is a TOML, YAML or JSON file that contains the options of maa,
The maa options contains three sections `connection`, `instance_options` and `resources`.

The `connection` section is used to connect to the game,
the `type` field can be `ADB` or `PlayTools`.
If you use `ADB`, you should set `adb_path` and `device` fields:
```toml
[connection]
type = "ADB"
adb_path = "adb" # the path of adb executable
device = "emulator-5554" # the serial of your android device
config = "General" # the config of maa
```
and if you use `PlayTools`, you should set `address`
which is the address of MaaTools set in PlayCover,
more details can be found at
[here](https://maa.plus/docs/en-us/1.4-EMULATOR_SUPPORTS_FOR_MAC.html#‚úÖ-playcover-the-software-runs-most-fluently-for-its-nativity-üöÄ):
```toml
[connection]
type = "PlayTools"
address = "localhost:1717" # the address of MaaTools
config = "CompatMac" # the same as above
```
Both `ADB` and `PlayTools` can set `config` field,
which is a parameter of `connect` function of maa.
It's default value is `CompatMac` on macOS, `General` on other platforms.
All available values can be found at `resource/config.json` in MAA repo.

And the `instance_options` section is used to configure maa instance options:
```toml
[instance_options]
touch_mode = "ADB" # touch mode to use, can be "ADB", "MiniTouch", "MAATouch" or "MacPlayTools" (only for PlayCover)
deployment_with_pause = false # whether pause the game when deployment
adb_lite_enabled = false # whether use adb-lite
kill_adb_on_exit = false # whether kill adb when exit
```
Note: If you connect to the game with `PlayCover`, the `touch_mode` must be `MacPlayTools`.

The `resources` section is used to configure additional resources of maa,
which is a list of resource directories (relative to `resource` directory of MAA repo):
```toml
resources = ["platform_diff/macOS"]
```
This is useful for adding other server game resources and
platform specific resource.

### Define tasks

A task should be defined with a TOML or JSON file, the located in `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/tasks`.

A task is consists of multiple subtasks,
available subtasks and params are defined by `type` and `params` fields,
it will passed to MaaCore, see [here](https://maa.plus/docs/en-us/3.1-INTEGRATION.html#asstappendtask) for more details:
```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "StartUp" # the type of maa task
params = { client_type = "Official", start_game_enabled = true } # the params of given task
```

If you want to run a task with different params based on some conditions,
you can define multiple variants of a task:
```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "Infrast"

[tasks.params]
mode = 10000
facility = ["Trade", "Reception", "Mfg", "Control", "Power", "Office", "Dorm"]
dorm_trust_enabled = true
filename = "normal.json" # the filename of custom infrast plan should located in `$MAA_CONFIG_DIR/infrast`

# use plan 1 before 12:00:00, use plan 2 between 12:00:00 and 18:00:00, use plan 0 after 18:00:00
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", end = "12:00:00" } # if start is not defined, it will be 00:00:00
params = { plan_index = 1 }

[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", start = "12:00:00", end = "18:00:00" }
params = { plan_index = 2 }

[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", start = "18:00:00" } # if end is not defined, it will be 23:59:59
params = { plan_index = 0 }
```
The `condition` field is used to determine whether the variant should be used,
and the `params` field of matched variant will be merged into the params of the task.

**Note**: this CLI will not read any content inside the infrast plan file,
including the time period defined in the `infrast` file,
so you must define the time period in the `condition` field.

Besides of `Time` condition, there are also `DateTime` and `Weakday` conditions:
```toml
[[tasks]]
type = "Fight"

# fight SL-8 on summer event
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { stage = "SL-8" }
condition = { type = "DateTime", start = "2023-08-01T16:00:00", end = "2023-08-21T03:59:59" }
# fight CE-6 on Tue, Thu, Sat if not on summer event
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Weekday", weekdays = ["Tue", "Thu", "Sat"] }
params = { stage = "CE-6" }
# fight 1-7 otherwise
[[tasks.variants]]
params = { stage = "1-7" }
```
If multiple variants are matched, the first one will be used.
And if the condition is not given, the variant will always be matched,
So you can put a variant without condition at the end of variants.

If no variant is matched, the task will not be executed,
which is useful when you want to only run a task in some conditions:
```toml
# Mall after 18:00
[[tasks]]
type = "Mall"
[tasks.params]
shopping = true
credit_fight = true
buy_first = ["ÊãõËÅòËÆ∏ÂèØ", "ÈæôÈó®Â∏Å"]
blacklist = ["Á¢≥", "ÂÆ∂ÂÖ∑", "Âä†ÊÄ•ËÆ∏ÂèØ"]
[[tasks.variants]]
condition = { type = "Time", start = "18:00:00" }
```

Example of config file can be found at [`config_examples` directory](./config_examples).
Anothor example can be found at my [dotfiles](https://github.com/wangl-cc/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/maa).

### Handle MAA core message

This CLI can handle MAA core message when running a task,
but not all messages will be printed,
the log level is used to control which message will be printed.
There are 6 log level:
- Error: something wrong, the program may exit or not work as expected;
- Warning: something wrong, but the program can still work;
- Normal: some important information, e.g. a task started and finished;
- Info: more detailed information, e.g. stage drop info;
- Debug: details about your configuration, e.g. the params of a task;
  this is useful for you to debug your configuration;
- Trace: any maa message from MAA core which is not handled by this CLI;
  this is useful for developers to debug this CLI.

The default log level is `Normal`, and it can be controlled by `-v` and `-q` options:
`-v` will increase the log level, and `-q` will decrease the log level.
