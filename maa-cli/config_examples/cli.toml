# passphrase = true
# 2. set `passphrase` to a environment variable, then maa-cli will use the environment variable as passphrase
# passphrase = { env = "MAA_SSH_PASSPHRASE" }
# 3. set `passphrase` to a command, then maa-cli will execute the command to get passphrase
# which is useful when you use a password manager to manage your passphrase
